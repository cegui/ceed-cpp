\begin_layout Section
Knowledge prerequisites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use the Unified Editor, you have to have some basic knowledge of how
 GUI systems work in general.
 It would be best if you were familiar with how CEGUI works but Qt or GTK
 knowledge can be transferred without problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For editing assets in 
\emph on
code mode
\emph default
 you should understand the format in question, the editor makes no effort
 to make code editing easier with highlighting or any code references (it's
 a planned feature though).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no need to understand programming in general to use CEED efficiently,
 the application is targeted at artists.
 You may still need help from a fellow programmer about setting up the project
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Installation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application is currently distributed as a source tarball that works
 on all supported platforms (if you install the dependencies).
 Furthermore, binary standalone builds are made for Windows and Apple MacOS
 X.
 This only applies to official releases, mercurial code is not being built
 regularly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Source tarball
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, make sure you have all dependencies installed.
 Refer to guides of the dependencies on how to install them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Download the tarball and extract it.
 You should end up with a folder called 
\emph on
CEED-${version}
\emph default
.
 Go into this folder in CLI
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

.
 This should trigger the installation.
 After the installation finishes, run 
\emph on
ceed-gui
\emph default
 to start the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Standalone executable (Win32)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You do not have to install anything in this case (all dependencies are bundled),
 just unzipping the archive and running 
\emph on
ceed-gui.exe
\emph default
 will make the application start.
 If this is not the case, please report it as a bug.

 Instead, a brief overview of some capabilities of the tools will be presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
ceed-gui
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main use of this executable is to bring up the CEED GUI interface.
 Most people will probably call it with no command line arguments at all.
 Some of the supported arguments might be very useful though, you can for
 example call ceed-gui so that it immediately loads a certain project and
 opens specific files.

 This can be very useful when you want to migrate all your assets to a new

Makes it possible to build a rectangle packed imageset out of given data.
 Source data is a

 In a nutshell you can specify separate image files or even imagesets and
 ceed-mic will make just one imageset with one underlying texture out of
 them.
 It will make effort to have the resulting texture as small as possible.

 Some will require you to close and open the edited file again and some
 will even require you to restart the application.
 If you experience glitches related to a settings change a restart will
 very likely cure them.
 We would still appreciate it if you reported them as a bug though, for
 further detail see Section

 to reset it to its default value.

 you reset them to default.
 In some cases you will even have to restart the application.

Common issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Cannot find PyCEGUI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming you are using a release source tarball, make sure you have installed
 PyCEGUI system-wide.
 Check the PyCEGUI.{so,dll} with 
\emph on
ldd -r
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
depends.exe
\emph default
 to check whether it can find all required libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also use the runwrapper.sh script if you use a UNIX system but that
 is not officially supported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Cannot find XYZ
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Install dependency XYZ, all dependency upstreams offer binary installers
 with the exception of PyCEGUI.
 Check with 
\emph on
ldd -r
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
depends.exe
\emph default
 to see whether the libraries can find their dependencies.

Cannot start 'hg'
\end_layout

 It will simply

 in cases where it is not possible to get the hash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
I only see a black viewport with outlines instead of my widgets!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure the widgets are set as visible! Many people create layouts with
 widgets hidden and then show them selectively after they are loaded.
 CEED will not display hidden widgets, it will only display their outlines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Imageset editing is unresponsive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two configurable modes of drawing the imageset editing viewport.
 The default one uses OpenGL and redraws the entire viewport when any redraw
 is needed.
 It has a predictable speed and does not stall often.
 It is suitable for all but the biggest imagesets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cases where you edit really big imagesets and/or have a slow GPU you
 can use the alternative mode.
 It uses software QPainter and only redraws portions that need it.
 This makes it a bit unpredictable with occasional stalls but it will be
 faster if you edit in a small area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The settings option is 
\emph on
Settings Â» Imageset editing Â» Use partial drawing updates
\emph default
